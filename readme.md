Ans:Primitive -store single values, immutable-(In build data type)
     1.String-sequence of character enclosed in a single or double quote     eg:("A"),("hello")
     
     2.Number
      floating point also consider as number

     value is not assigned
     
     5.Null-intentional absence of the value
    let user=null
    
    6.Symbols
    7.NaN(Not a Number)
    clg(Number("Arsha))

    Non primitive-stores collections or complex data(derived from primitive data type)
        1. Array -collection of data enclosed in a [] separated with comma

        2. Object-
         collection of related data enclosed in {}  and separate with comma the elements are written in key value pairs
         let user={
             firstname:"Arsha",
             lastname:"S",
             Roll no:27,

11. What is the difference between WorldWideWeb and World Wide Web?
Ans:
WorldWideWeb: The first browser/editor

12. Explain primitive and non-primitive datatypes in JavaScript.
Ans:
Primitive: Stored by value (Number, String, Boolean, etc.)
Non-Primitive: Stored by reference (Object, Array, Function)

13. What is NodeJS?
Ans:
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, mainly for server-side applications.
14. What is V8 engine?
Ans:
The V8 is a JavaScript engine developed by Google that compiles JavaScript into machine code for fast execution.
15. What are the naming conventions of variables in JS?
Ans:

   1. Variables are case sensitive
   eg: myname!=myName(different )
   
   2. Variable can be simple character,multiple character or alphanumerical
